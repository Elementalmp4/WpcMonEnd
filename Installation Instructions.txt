Thank you for choosing WpcMonEnd. Here is what you will get from this program:

-Microsoft family safety monitor will be blocked upon login
-Any restrictions laid out by Family Safety Monitor will be disabled automatically
-Monitoring of your device usage will be blocked 
-Monitoring data will not be sent to the parent accounts

NOTE: You will require the administrator password/admin rights to use this program

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:

1) Navigate to C:\Users\(USERNAME)\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup
   replacing (USERNAME) with your username

2) Copy and paste the "WpcMonEnd.cmd" program into the startup folder

3) Reboot your PC

USAGE INSTRUCTIONS

Once your PC boots up, you should get an administrator prompt which asks you to 
allow administrator privileges for Windows Command Prompt. You want to allow this.

After that, you should see a console window which says that WpcMon.exe has been terminated or there 
was an error. In this case, Family safety monitor either isn't running or Microsoft has patched this program.

Once the process is terminated, you can press enter to close the console, and enjoy your surveillance-free
computer!

Alternatively, you can go to task manager if you do not have admin priviliges and you can find "Family Safety Monitor" and end task.
